# Data_Challenges
This is a repository for different data challenges that I might face. Most of them are not complete version and have been a time limited attempt to practice for such conditions. Those will be completed gradually if I have more time. To experience a better view of the notebooks I suggest to use nbviewer. In the follow a link is provided to each of the jupyter notebooks in this repository using nbviewer.
